\section{Zero-Knowledge Proof Construction}

Let $pk$ be the proving key, $vk$ be the verification key, and $g$ be a generator of the elliptic curve.

\subsection{Genetic Traits}

Let $T$ be the set of numeric genetic traits associated with the user.

\subsection{Private Key and Genetic Data}

The user has a private key $sk$ and genetic data $D$.

\subsection{Proof Generation}

To prove possession of genetic traits in $T$, the user constructs the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each genetic trait $t \in T$, compute the commitment $C_t = g^{sk} \cdot t$.
    \item Compute a random blinding factor $r$.
    \item Construct the commitment to the blinded genetic data $C_D = g^{sk} \cdot D \cdot g^{r}$.
    \item Construct the zero-knowledge proof $\pi$ such that $\pi$ proves that the user knows $sk$ and $r$ such that $C_D$ is a valid commitment to $D$ and each $C_t$ is a valid commitment to the genetic traits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proof Verification}

The verifier, possessing the verification key $vk$, verifies the proof as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Verify that the commitments $C_D$ and $C_t$ are valid on the elliptic curve.
    \item Verify that the zero-knowledge proof $\pi$ is valid.
    \item If all verifications pass, the verifier accepts the proof and confirms that the user possesses the genetic traits in $T$.
\end{itemize}
